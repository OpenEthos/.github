## OpenEthos üõ°Ô∏è

In today's fast-paced development environment, proactive security and compliance are paramount. Our projects aim to simplify this complex process by providing tooling that is easy to integrate, highly scalable, and focused on real-time security assurance for Python applications.

### Our Mission

To foster a culture of secure development by providing accessible, high-quality, and community-driven tools that embed regulatory and best-practice security checks into the software development lifecycle (SDLC). We believe that compliance should be code, not paperwork.
